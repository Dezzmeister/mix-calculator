# Schedule One Mix Calculator

Unlike all the other mix calculators, this one implements the same algorithm
that Schedule One uses to calculate mixes. I reverse-engineered the game's
binary to discover how this algorithm worked. This calculator includes
an interactive visualization of the algorithm and some info on how it works.

You can see this calculator at https://mix.ooo.

## TODOs

 - Fill in README with description of mixing algorithm
 - Trim identical mixer maps from JSON to reduce bundle size
 - More transformations to make bundle smaller
